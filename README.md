# Worflow
For the completion of this Master’s thesis, a robust and integrated technical stack has been selected to ensure academic rigour and structural integrity. Zotero serves as the primary reference manager to maintain a centralised database of literature and to automate the generation of bibliographies. Obsidian is utilised for the preliminary stages of research to facilitate atomic note taking and the synthesis of complex ideas through its bidirectional linking capabilities. The final manuscript is produced using Quarto, which provides a professional environment for technical writing and ensures that the document adheres to the specific formatting requirements of the university.
