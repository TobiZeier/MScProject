# Introduction to the Literature

The purpose of this literature review is to evaluate the current state of Enterprise IT frameworks and their evolution in the context of cloud-native digital transformation.

# The Evolution of IT Governance

The shift from on-premise infrastructure to cloud-based services has fundamentally challenged traditional governance models. According to , legacy frameworks like COBIT 5 often lack the agility required for DevOps environments.

## Strategic Alignment Models

Strategic alignment remains a cornerstone of IT management. The Henderson-Venkatraman model continues to be relevant, though recent scholars argue it must be adapted for the "as-a-service" economy.

### Challenges in Hybrid Environments

One of the most significant themes in recent literature is the "complexity gap" in hybrid cloud management.

-   **Security Latency:** Managing identity across multiple providers.
-   **Cost Opacity:** The transition from CapEx to OpEx models.
-   **Skill Shortages:** The lack of certified enterprise architects in the UK market.

# Theoretical Framework

For the purpose of this thesis, I will adopt the **Resource-Based View (RBV)** of the firm. This framework suggests that IT is not just a utility, but a strategic asset that provides a competitive advantage.

## Conceptual Model

The relationship between governance and performance can be visualized in below:
