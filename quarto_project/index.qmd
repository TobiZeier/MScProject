  This thesis investigates the tension between traditional IT governance frameworks and the rapid adoption of cloud-native technologies within the UK financial sector. As organizations move toward 'As-a-Service' models, legacy alignment strategies often fail to address the complexities of hybrid-cloud environments. Using a mixed-methods approach, this research identifies key barriers to strategic alignment and proposes a modernized governance framework tailored for high-compliance IT environments.
